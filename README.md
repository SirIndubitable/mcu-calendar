<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This started out as just a script to upload MCU release dates to a Google Calender.
Previously I've found calendars that other people maintained manually that eventually went stale.
The intention of this repo is that the release information can be crowd sourced and easy to pick up if I ever drop the ball on maintaing it.

I've had many requests for other calenders so I've added support for other calendars.

## Calendars
For each calendar I will list the URl and if you would like to add it directly to your calender, the public iCal address will also be listed
### MCU
